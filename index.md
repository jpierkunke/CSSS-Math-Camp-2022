## Welcome to Math Camp!

Offered at the University of Washington each September since 2014, the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences (CSSS)](https://csss.uw.edu/){:target="_blank"} has provided [this math camp](https://csss.uw.edu/academics/math-camp){:target="_blank"} as a one-week review of mathematics and probability.

  **Instructor:** Jess Kunke, PhD Student in Statistics
  
  **TA:** Erin Lipman, PhD Student in Statistics

**Intended audience:**

Math camp is open to any entering or current UW graduate students and is particularly suitable for
* Social science graduate students interested in pursuing a quantitatively-oriented research career
* Social science graduate students in the early years of study in departments with CSSS tracks
* Graduate students preparing for advanced CSSS statistics courses

**Objectives:**

* Prepare students for CSSS and other advanced courses in statistical methodology
* Focus on conceptual foundation, basic tools, and confidence building
* Provide some introduction to programming/statistics in R

This workshop **does not** assume prior exposure to this material; math skills through high school
algebra are helpful but can be reviewed. Part of the purpose of this workshop is that students may use lecture notes and web materials to refresh their memories of key concepts and tools as they continue in research and coursework.

## Schedule

Math camp will be offered in a hybrid form this year; participants may participate in person or via Zoom. Our **tentative** workshop schedule is as follows:

  **9am-12pm, [SAV 260](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/sav):**  Review math concepts, do practice problems
  
  **1-3pm, [CSSCR Big Lab (SAV 117)](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/sav):** Introduction to programming and statistics in R
  
  **3-4pm, [CSSCR Big Lab (SAV 117)](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/sav):** Office hour if needed
  
Slides and materials will be linked to in the schedule below as they are made available. Much of the course material provided here was first created by Laina Mercer with developments by [Jessica Godwin](https://jlgodwin.github.io/MathCamp){:target="_blank"} and [Peter Gao](https://peteragao.github.io/CSSS-Math-Camp-2021/). Jess Kunke has contributed to developing the labs since 2021.
