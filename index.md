## Schedule

Our tentative workshop schedule is as follows:

Slides and materials will be linked to in the schedule below as they are made available. Much of the course material provided here was first created by Laina Mercer with developments by [Jessica Godwin](https://jlgodwin.github.io/MathCamp) and Peter Gao. Jess Kunke has added to and developed the lab materials in particular.
